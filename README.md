## Insight Shogun

### Unleashing the Power of NLP and Knowledge Graphs

**Insight Shogun** is a comprehensive tool that combines the prowess of web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge graph creation. Inspired by the strategic mastery of a Shogun, this project aims to provide deep insights from news articles, establishing meaningful connections between entities and topics.

### Features

- **Web Scraping**: Efficiently extract article titles, publication dates, content, and URLs from various news websites using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify key entities such as people, organizations, and locations within the content using `spaCy`.
- **Keywords Extraction**: Utilize the OpenAI API to extract significant keywords from the articles, adding another layer of analysis.
- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Build and visualize a knowledge graph using `Neo4j`, representing relationships between entities and articles.
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage the OpenAI API to uncover additional relationships between entities, identifying deeper insights and connections within the content.

### How It Works

1. **Scrape Articles**: Extract detailed information from news websites.
2. **Process Content**: Use NLP techniques to identify entities and keywords within the articles.
3. **Build Knowledge Graph**: Create nodes for entities and articles, and establish relationships based on their co-occurrence and shared keywords.
4. **Enhance with LLM**: Utilize the power of language models to reveal hidden relationships and deeper insights.
